This command adds or removes an object from the blacklist. It could be a server, channel, or user.
Using response_server or response_channel will allow commands to still work, but not the text responses.

*Usage:*
`hesa blacklist <add, remove>; <"server: [server ID]", "channel: [channel ID]", "response_server: [server ID]", "response_channel: [channel ID]", "user: [user's ID]">`

*Examples:*
`hesa blacklist add; response_channel: 1234567890` will stop Hesa from doing text responses in the specified channel
